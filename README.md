# Lesion Detection on ISIC Dataset with YOLOv7

## Description:

> This project aims to detect lesions in dermoscopic images from the ISIC 2017/2018 dataset using the YOLOv7 object detection model. The primary goal is to implement a solution that achieves a minimum Intersection Over Union (IoU) of 0.8 on the test set, ensuring reliable detection and localization of lesions within each image. Additionally, the model is expected to achieve a suitable accuracy for lesion classification, enhancing the utility of this approach for real-world applications in skin cancer detection.
